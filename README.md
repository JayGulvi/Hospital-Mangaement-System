Our project Hospital Management system includes registration of patients, storing their
details into the system, and also booking their appointments with doctors.
Our software has the facility to give a unique id for every patient and stores the details
of every patient and the staff automatically. User can search availability of a doctor and
the details of a patient using the id. The Hospital Management
System can be entered using a username and password. It is accessible either by an
administrator or receptionist. Only they can add data into the database. The data can be
retrieved easily. The interface is very user-friendly. The data are well protected for
personal use and makes the data processing very fast
